Week 7 and 8 , kali vs Docker 

Vulnerability 1. 

. In my blog, out of all the pages i have , I had a few particular set of pages which I am intended to show only to a few people. 


I also have one generic page with the following URL: http://localhost:8080/?page_id=4

Now as a hacker, I can keep trying to change the id number and in a lucky situation, I had landed on a page which is not intended to design me. 

http://localhost:8080/?page_id=2. 

This is a URL manipulation vulnerability. 

Wordpress version 4.1
